# OOP School Library
### SchoolLibrary

Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow a you to:

    - Add new students or teachers.

    - Add new books.

    - Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
